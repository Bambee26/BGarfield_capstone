#### Abstract: Abstract to be completed at the end of the project

### Introduction
- Breast cancer statistics in the US, including incidence rates, survival rates, and impact.
- Importance of awareness and regular screenings for reducing mortality rates.

### Goals of this Research
- Investigate correlation between features like radius, texture, etc., and breast cancer diagnosis.
- Assess effectiveness of machine learning models in diagnosing breast cancer.
- Aim to contribute to personalized medical care in breast cancer.

### Final Report
The final report has been written using LaTex in Overleaf, which can be accessed [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mnxndtrqqwyk#7112d5).

### Dataset
- Dataset extracted from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), originally from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison.
- Dataset includes 30 features from fine needle aspirations (FNA) of 569 breast masses.

### Data Processing
- All code is located in our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Bambee26/capstone_project).
- To use the GitHub repo, fork and clone into VS Code.
- Execute a virtual environment:
    - In a new terminal, run:
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
- Activate virtual environment, run:
    ```sh
    .venv\Scripts\Activate
- VS Code dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install, run:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt

- EDA process includes indentifying central tendencies, dispersion, and shape of the distribution analyzed. Tables, pie charts, histograms and a heat map were created here to visualize data distribution by diagnosis. â€‹
